# my_money_detection
my final project in my ID Tech camp

Hello my Name is Leo and as my final project for my ID Tech course I wanted to develop a money detection programm for Euro Bills,
in the momment my programm can only define 5, 10 and 20 Euro.
Its still a work in progress waht means there is still a chance that my programm will output the wrong Euro ammount.

I thought to make this project for the blind people in the world so that they can seperate there money easyly.


the code is the classification/train.py file
